This Web Application acts like a personal assistant for individuals.
I have implemented a To-do list feature which would let the user add,edit and delete their task.This is very helpful for any professional as it helps to keep every task of theirs sorted and in a single place.
Further features which can be added to this application are :
1.Notes - which would let the person to add,edit and delete some important notes
2.Do Not Disturb mode - which wpuld restrict the user from acccessing sites which makes them less productive.This idea can be achieved by gaining the user's browser activity.
3.Linking Linked-In to this application so that they get customised notifications for their promotions/job-search.
